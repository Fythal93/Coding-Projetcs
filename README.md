# Coding-Projetcs
This is a repository of past programming projects I have done in high school and university. 
This repository is for employers and other coders who are interested in past projects that I have done. 
I'm pretty sure that all these projects should still be able to run. 
I don't really plan on updating them as I like to look back on my old projects to see how far I have come :P
